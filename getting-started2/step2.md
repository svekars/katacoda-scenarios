Moreover, data scientists should be able to trace back their results.
If you deploy a multi-stage data science pipeline that collects the
data from multiple sources, this becomes a challenging task.

Pachyderm enables you to track data lineage back through multiple
steps and stages of your data science pipeline so that you can see
where your final result originates in. Pachyderm empowers data scientists
to take actions on mending a corrupted machine learning model. And in
reality this happens a lot.
