Pachyderm adheres to the best principles of modern infrastructure
which include the following:

* Cloud-native. Pachyderm is built to run in a cloud of your choice.
Because Pachyderm runs on top of Kubernetes, Pachyderm can be
deployed locally or in the cloud on top of any Kubernetes distribution.
Pachyderm workers are deployed as Kubernetes pods.

* Enables horizontal team collaboration. Diverse teams of data scientists
that use various tools and work on multiple projects can collaborate on
the same project.

* Easy to integrate. Pachyderm already integrates with popular data science
tools, such as Kubeflow and JupyterHub and more integrations are on the roadmap.
